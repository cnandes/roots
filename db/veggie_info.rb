    "Prepare the soil by removing all weeds and any other debris, and then tilling the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches.",
    "You can plant onions from seed or from sets, sets are small bulbs that are planted and have a head start on growth. When planting sets, be sure to plant them with the pointed end facing up, about an inch deep and spaced about an inch apart.",
    "Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. A good way to ensure this is to mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture in the soil.",
    "Onions are light feeders, so they don't require a lot of fertilizer. But if you choose to use it, use a well-balanced fertilizer, or a side dressing of compost or well-rotted manure.",

    "Water the corn regularly, providing 1-2 inches of water per week, especially during dry spells.",
    "Corn is wind-pollinated, so it is important to plant it in blocks of at least 4 rows, rather than in a single row, to ensure good pollination and good ear development.",
    "To control weeds and retain moisture, mulch the area around the corn plants with straw, leaves, or grass clippings.",
